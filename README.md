# The Myth of Satonia
## Description
This is a passion project I've been working on inspired by The Legend of Zelda, the code will be visible all throughout, and I have plans to make the project completely open-source after development ends for those who are willing to stick around. This is planned to be a dungeon game, with a story that I will write myself.
## Compilation
If you wish to use the source code to rebuild, or edit the project, go ahead at it, even for commercial use. Just make sure to give credit to this project and you're set. If you plan to do so, the GUI will not work unless you have Hydrophilla Iced Regular (TTF) which is not already packaged as per the license of the creator. You can try to use other fonts, but make sure you change the path to the font in the main source file where load_font() was called.
Also, you need to include the "include" folder with your project, otherwise none of the header files will be visible to the project.

## Roadmap 🚀
Here is the planned roadmap for beta as of 2025/12/19

#### v0.7b - Storytelling 📖

#### v0.8b - TBD❓

### Fixes 🛠️
Expect me to focus heavily on bug fixing, as I do not want a non-functioning game to be released.
### When to expect updates ⏱️
Expect updates every 1-3 months, as I have school and update size may vary, but do expect occasional patches or mini-updates.
