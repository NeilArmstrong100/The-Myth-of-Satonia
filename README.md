# The Myth of Satonia
## Description
This is a passion project I've been working on inspired by The Legend of Zelda, the code will be visible all throughout, and I have plans to make the project completely open-source after development ends for those who are willing to stick around. This is planned to be a dungeon game, with a story that I will write myself.
### Announcement
I will release version 0.2 by the end of the month, if not, probably early September.
